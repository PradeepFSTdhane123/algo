# Polymorphism in C++

Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism enables functions to use objects of different types through a single interface.

---

## 1. What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means "many shapes" in Greek. In C++, polymorphism allows you to redefine the way functions behave for different types. It can be classified into two main types:

- **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**: Achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.
- **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**: Achieved using inheritance and virtual functions.

---

## 2. Types of Polymorphism in C++

### a. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)

Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the function to be invoked is determined at compile time. It is achieved using:

1. **Function Overloading**
2. **Operator Overloading**

---

### i. Function Overloading

Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or numbers to coexist.

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void display(int i) {
        cout << "Displaying int: " << i << endl;
    }

    void display(double d) {
        cout << "Displaying double: " << d << endl;
    }

    void display(string s) {
        cout << "Displaying string: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print obj;
    obj.display(5);
    obj.display(6.7);
    obj.display("Hello");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
Displaying int: 5
Displaying double: 6.7
Displaying string: Hello
```

---

### ii. Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (such as classes).

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    float real, imag;

public:
    Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex &obj) {
        Complex temp;
        temp.real = real + obj.real;
        temp.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return temp;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Real: " << real << ", Imaginary: " << imag << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1, c2, result;
    result = c1 + c2;
    result.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
Real: 0, Imaginary: 0
```

---

## 3. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Runtime polymorphism occurs when the function call is resolved at runtime. It is achieved using **inheritance** and **virtual functions**.

### a. Virtual Functions

A virtual function is a member function that is declared within the base class and redefined by a derived class. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

#### Syntax:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void function_name() {
        // Base class code
    }
};
```

---

### Example of Runtime Polymorphism:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "This is an animal sound." << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "The dog barks." << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "The cat meows." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;

    animalPtr = &dog;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Calls Dog's sound()

    animalPtr = &cat;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Calls Cat's sound()

    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
The dog barks.
The cat meows.
```

---

## 4. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function with no definition in the base class, and a class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. You cannot instantiate an abstract class.

#### Syntax:

```cpp
class AbstractBase {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};
```

### Example of Abstract Class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void area() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void area() {
        cout << "Area of Circle" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Circle c;
    c.area();  // Calls Circle's area function
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
Area of Circle
```

## 5. Advantages of Polymorphism

1. **Code Reusability**: Allows functions to operate on different types.
2. **Flexibility**: Easier to change or extend the system with new types.
3. **Maintainability**: Polymorphism simplifies code structure and reduces complexity.

---

## 6. Final Thoughts

Polymorphism in C++ provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for handling multiple types of objects and making your code more scalable and maintainable. It's a crucial concept in OOP and is used extensively in software development.

Happy coding!
