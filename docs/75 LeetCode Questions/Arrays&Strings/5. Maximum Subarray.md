## 53. Maximum subarray.
**Description**: 
 Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum. The problem involves efficiently finding the maximum subarray sum by considering all subarrays that end at each index, making Kadane's Algorithm an optimal choice.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
Input: nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 

**Explanation:** 
-The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum of 6.
- 
### Example 2:

**Input:** Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10.
**Explanation:** 
-All elements are  sum is high so the this is whole subarray sum is greater.

 **C++ Code**:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize the current subarray sum and the result (max sum)
        int curr = nums[0];
        int result = nums[0];
        
        // Loop through the array starting from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Update the current subarray sum: either extend the current subarray or start fresh
            curr = max(curr + nums[i], nums[i]);
            // Update the result (global max sum)
            result = max(result, curr);
        }
        
        // Return the maximum subarray sum
        return result;
    }
};


```
### Approach and code explanation ###
**Algorithm used:**
-Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is a powerful and efficient method for solving the maximum subarray problem, offering a clear approach with optimal time and space complexities. This method leverages the properties of subarrays to make localized decisions that lead to a global optimal solution.

**2. Iterating Through the Array:**
- Initialization:
The curr variable starts with the first element of the array because we want to have at least one element in our subarray.
The result variable also starts with the first element, ensuring we have a base case for comparison.

**Loop through the Array:**
- The loop begins at index 1 since we've already used index 0 for initialization.
- For each element nums[i], we calculate:
This line compares the sum of the current subarray (curr + nums[i]) with starting a new subarray at nums[i]. If adding nums[i] to curr gives a smaller sum than nums[i] alone, then curr is reset to nums[i].

**Updating the Result:**
-The line result = max(result, curr); ensures that if the current subarray sum (curr) exceeds the previously recorded maximum (result), we update result.

**Final Return:**
- After processing all elements, result contains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, which is then returned.

### Example with explanation ###
- nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

Initialization:

Start with:
curr = nums[0] = -2
result = nums[0] = -2
Iteration:

We'll iterate through the array starting from index 1 (the second element):

Index 1: nums[1] = 1

Calculate: curr = max(-2 + 1, 1) = max(-1, 1) = 1
Update: result = max(-2, 1) = 1
Index 2: nums[2] = -3

Calculate: curr = max(1 - 3, -3) = max(-2, -3) = -2
Update: result = max(1, -2) = 1
Index 3: nums[3] = 4

Calculate: curr = max(-2 + 4, 4) = max(2, 4) = 4
Update: result = max(1, 4) = 4
Index 4: nums[4] = -1

Calculate: curr = max(4 - 1, -1) = max(3, -1) = 3
Update: result = max(4, 3) = 4
Index 5: nums[5] = 2

Calculate: curr = max(3 + 2, 2) = max(5, 2) = 5
Update: result = max(4, 5) = 5
Index 6: nums[6] = 1

Calculate: curr = max(5 + 1, 1) = max(6, 1) = 6
Update: result = max(5, 6) = 6
Index 7: nums[7] = -5

Calculate: curr = max(6 - 5, -5) = max(1, -5) = 1
Update: result = max(6, 1) = 6
Index 8: nums[8] = 4

Calculate: curr = max(1 + 4, 4) = max(5, 4) = 5
Update: result = max(6, 5) = 6
Final Result:
After processing all elements, the final value of result is 6.

### complexcity
#### Time Complexity:
Reason: The algorithm iterates through the array exactly once. For each element, it performs a constant amount of work (calculating the maximum of two values). Thus, if n is the number of elements in the array, the total time complexity is linear: O(n).

#### Space complexity: #### 
-Reason: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. It only maintains a few integer variables (curr and result), and does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input. Therefore, the space complexity is constant: O(1).
